### A web-based application aims to help instructors with their students
1- the instructor makes a Word document in a specific drive folder containing the lesson he wants to explain
2- the instructor makes comments on the work (text/audio) and handles its format and colors
3- give it a name 

4- a student who wants to see the lesson will go to our website
5- type the name ("Code") in the search field and Volaa 
6- in an exciting user interface, it will appear the lesson and comments from his instructor.

### The project goal is to fill the gap between instructors and students after school by adding a valuable, interesting method to make students love to study
