#### A web-based application aims to help instructors with their students
- the instructor makes a Word document in a specific drive folder containing the lesson he wants to explain
- the instructor makes comments on the work (text/audio) and handles its format and colors
- give it a name.

- a student who wants to see the lesson will go to our website
- type the name ("Code") in the search field and Volaa 
- in an exciting user interface, it will appear the lesson and comments from his instructor.
